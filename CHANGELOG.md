# Changelog

## 0.4.0 - AIFlowBridge

### Fixed

- Fixed `prepareForDeactivate` making an unnecessary `selectChatModels` call that caused a `Canceled` warning on extension deactivation.
- Fixed gateway port conflict when extension is activated in multiple VS Code instances. The gateway now detects if an existing AIFlowBridge gateway is already running on the default port and joins it instead of failing.

### Changed

- Gateway now operates as a singleton across VS Code instances: if the default port (8787) is already occupied by another AIFlowBridge instance, the new instance detects and reuses the existing gateway rather than starting a new one on a different port. This ensures Kilo Code and other OpenAI-compatible clients always find the gateway at the configured URL.

## 0.3.0 - AIFlowBridge

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files (`deepseek-convert.test.ts`, `deepseek-error.test.ts`, `deepseek-classifier.test.ts`, `minimax.test.ts`, `xiaomi.test.ts`).
- Fixed `MockSecretStorage` class identifier conflicts and event emitter type issues in test helpers.
- Fixed tool description type compatibility (now requires non-optional `string`).

### Changed

- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the Minimax provider, covering model ID resolution, tool argument parsing, tool call accumulation, message conversion, and error handling.
- Added tests for the error handling module, including ProviderRequestError creation and HTTP error normalization.
- Introduced Vitest configuration for running tests in a Node environment with appropriate timeouts and module resolution.
- Add unit tests for Minimax, Xiaomi, and error handling
